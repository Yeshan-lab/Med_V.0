# Med_V.0

This website is a prototype created to demonstrate the AI usage in healthcare industry. It was basically created for a project of my own.
It uses Rule-Based AI, which means it is not a programmed AI model, yet a well functional demonstration of an AI. 
For the time period it is only programmed for about 15 general illnesses. It can be upgraded by including more symptoms and conditions inside the database. 

It is currently hosted in https://suwasetha.vercel.app
